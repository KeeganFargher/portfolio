# Keegan Fargher

Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm a full stack web and mobile app developer at Netgen Custom Software. I enjoy working with .Net Core, Next.js and React Native.

Some of my daily activities and work I have done include:

- Integrating Unit & Integration testing into the project work flow
- Setting up CI / CD for projects using Azure Devops
- Setting up coding workflow process using code reviews, pull requests,
  branches and CI / CD
- Architecting new systems and maintaining existing systems
- Setup a reusable admin portal template which included authentication
  (login, forgot password, etc.), user management, email and SMS sending
  which sped up our projects by ~3 weeks
- Mentoring and training up new hires
- Mainting client relationships
- Improving our clients' system architecture by migrating from .NET
  Framework to NET Core, integrating SOLID principals and implementing a
  3-tier architecture (Presentation, Application and Data tier)
- Integrated a self-hosted instance of Sentry using Docker & Docker Compose
